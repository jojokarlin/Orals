### Media Studies
Social networks and new media increasingly influence our relationship to correspondence. By looking at how scholars have theorized new media, I hope to get a clearer sense of how the message is medium works across distributed communications platforms. With the Kittler and McLuhan, I aim to ground my reading in the works that defined Media Studies. Drucker, Gitelman, and Hayles will

Kittler may disagree with McLuhan about the extent to which machines are contiguous with humans, but he offers a compelling view of metaphors of one media manifested in another. These essays importantly demonstrate...

* Drucker

Johanna Drucker's seminal text about contemporary visual culture not only recognizes the power of ubiquitous visualization to structure our relationship to information, but it also demonstrates how presentation can be production of knowledge. Of particular interest to my work, she addresses the graphical user interface (GUI) and the ways these interfaces shape knowledge, behavior and identity. Though text and letters have always been mediated, the shift to more digital communication means that the mediation of our personal correspondence has shifted. Understanding Drucker's critical vocabulary of visual mediation is especially relevant when considering epistolary shifts.

* Gitelman

Gitelman's history of documents provides an important media grounding. While her chosen are more process-based and administrative in nature than the personal letter, they provide a necessary corrollary to the history of email. As these technologies have aimed to make our lives more efficient, they have also influenced our documentation of our own lives. She charts the history of paper stubs -- the library card, the promissory note, the movie ticket, the PDF (Portable Document Format) -- and processes -- letterpress printing, typing and carbon paper, mimeograph, microfilm, offset printing, photocopying, and scanning. 

* McGann

McGann's radiant compilation emulates his sense of radiating texts. Ranging widely, **Radiant Textuality** spans diverse areas of humanities theory and method. McGann looks at the shift that occurred with the emergence of the internet, which "globalized access to computerized resources and information," and "made interface and computer graphics paramount concerns for work in digital culture."

#### Carey
Carey provides a philosophical argument in favor of Communications studies as fundamental to a cultural studies model of language and literature scholarship. 

### Textual Scholarship
Collecting letters is an important act in the twenty-first century. A number of projects exist to recuperate the letters that have fallen away as email has become the primary mode of personal correspondence. Letter collections are still published, but not necessarily read as history as much as they once were. To correspond with my primary source letters (see NKM list), I am including necessary texts about critical editions. To understand how best to address these necessarily curated works (even in reading comprehensive collections of letters, the hand of the editor is flagrantly visible), I must have a grounding in textual scholarship. I am interested to see how letters come into email and how email find their way into authors' archives. Both of these interests come within textual scholarship.
