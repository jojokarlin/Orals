# Rationale

Even before national postal systems were introduced in the 18th century, letters carried between people offered a way to externalize personal communication, to bring people closer even when they were geographically distant. Conventions of address and confidentiality, of contents and conveyance, developed in relation to practical needs, physical, economic and political infrastructures, as well as epistemological currents. Who received a letter depended on who could write one, who could afford to send one, who had grounds for communicating, where postal service existed. Telegraphy gained national reach in the middle of the 19th century and in this extension, effectively decoupled communication from transportation. News could travel ahead of people. The news also came through signals rather than as transported missives. The hand to hand communication was now passing through operators and electric pulses. Several translations occurred. And yet, the word, the text, arrived in quicker order.
