    This study investigated the relationship among three types of presences,
    including place presence, social presence, and co-presence in virtual worlds
    and their relationship with satisfaction and immersive tendencies of
    students. Students' scores on a subjective questionnaire were analyzed. The
    results indicated that there was a significant relationship among the place
    presence, social presence, and co-presence. While social presence seemed to
    affect the satisfaction most, place and co-presence also affected students'
    satisfaction in the virtual world. Moreover, immersive tendencies of the
    students were related to their place and co-presence but not to their social
    presence. Findings highlighted the important issues for the design of
    virtual world environments to increase presence and satisfaction of
    students. (Contains 3 figures and 2 tables.)

  abstract: >-
    In this original study, Milne moves between close readings of letters,
    postcards and emails, and investigations of the material, technological
    infrastructures of these forms, to answer the question: How does presence
    function as an aesthetic and rhetorical strategy within networked
    communication practices? As her work reveals, the relation between old and
    new communication systems is more complex than allowed in much contemporary
    media theory. Although the correspondents of letters, postcards and emails
    are not, usually, present to one another as they write and read their
    exchanges, this does not necessarily inhibit affective communication.
    Indeed, this study demonstrates how physical absence may, in some instances,
    provide correspondents with intense intimacy and a spiritual, almost
    telepathic, sense of the other’s presence. While corresponding by letter,
    postcard or email, readers construe an imaginary, incorporeal body for their
    correspondents that, in turn, reworks their interlocutor’s
    self-presentation. In this regard the fantasy of presence reveals a key
    paradox of cultural communication, namely that material signifiers can be
    used to produce the experience of incorporeal presence.

  abstract: >-
    "In this classic text, James W. Carey maintains that communication is not
    merely the transmission of information. Reminding the reader of the link
    between the words "communication" and "community," he broadens his
    definition to include the drawing-together of a people that is culture. In
    this context, Carey questions the American tradition of focusing only on
    mass communication's function as a means of social and political control,
    and makes a case for examining the content of a communication - the meaning
    of symbols, not only the motives that originate them or the purposes they
    serve. He seeks to recast the goal of communications studies, replacing the
    search for deterministic laws of behavior with a simpler, yet far more
    challenging mission: "to enlarge the human conversation by comprehending
    what others are saying."" "This new edition includes a new critical foreword
    by G. Stuart Adam that explains Carey's fundamental role in transforming the
    study of mass communication to include a cultural perspective and connects
    his classic essays with contemporary media issues and trends. This edition
    also adds a new, complete bibliography of all of Carey's writings."--Jacket

    On july 27, 1929, *Lindbergh’s Flight,* a cantata for radio written by
    Bertolt Brecht (2003), with a score by Paul Hindemith and Kurt Weill,
    premiered as a live performance at the Festival for German Chamber Music in
    Baden-Baden. At once celebrating and commenting critically on Charles
    Lindbergh’s historic solo crossing of the Atlantic two years earlier, the
    piece also advances Brecht’s famous appeal for an application of the
    relatively new technology of the radio that would go beyond the function of
    a few-to-many broadcasting system in the grip of a capitalist media elite to
    become a means of many-to-many communication

  title: 'Track changes: a literary history of word processing'
  publisher: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press
  number-of-pages: '344'
  source: Library of Congress ISBN
  abstract: >-
    "The story of writing in the digital age is every bit as messy as the
    ink-stained rags that littered the floor of Gutenberg's print shop or the
    hot molten lead of the linotype machine. During the period of the pivotal
    growth and widespread adoption of word processing as a writing technology,
    some authors embraced it as a marvel while others decried it as the death of
    literature. The product of years of archival research and numerous
    interviews conducted by the author, Track Changes is the first literary
    history of word processing. Matthew Kirschenbaum examines how the interests
    and ideals of creative authorship came to coexist with the computer
    revolution. Who were the first adopters? What kind of anxieties did they
    share? Was word processing perceived as just a better typewriter or
    something more? How did it change our understanding of writing? Track
    Changes balances the stories of individual writers with a consideration of
    how the seemingly ineffable act of writing is always grounded in particular
    instruments and media, from quills to keyboards. Along the way, we discover
    the candidates for the first novel written on a word processor, explore the
    surprisingly varied reasons why writers of both popular and serious
    literature adopted the technology, trace the spread of new metaphors and
    ideas from word processing in fiction and poetry, and consider the fate of
    literary scholarship and memory in an era when the final remnants of
    authorship may consist of folders on a hard drive or documents in the
    cloud."--Provided by publisher

    With the rise of digital inscription technologies, the history of the
    twenty-first century will not be written by human hands alone. From
    surveillance systems to medical databases to networked computers, automated
    processes of information and exchange are already encoding an alternative
    history of humanity and coauthoring the stories of the next century. Smart
    phones log global position, online advertisements count clicks per capita,
    search engines index content (and “personalize” results) in real time, and
    automatic backup applications record the state of your hard drive so you can
    “revisit your [computer] as it appeared in the past” (Apple 2012). Nowhere
