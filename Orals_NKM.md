Timely Letters

After Telegraphy decoupled communication from transportation, the transportational needs of communication shifted. Bernhard Siegert’s Relays: Literature as an Epoch of the Postal System (1992) and James W. Carey’s Communication as Culture (1989) persuade me that the shift in concept of communication introduced by commercial telegraphy (as an instrument of empire and of administration), while neither clean nor consistent, marks a turn in the tide of epistolary correspondence. I plan, therefore, to look more closely at several instances which demonstrate the ways stresses on the mechanisms of post inflect the sense of time in these communications. With Joan Richardson, I am looking at the metaphor and method of communication as messages in time. With Matt Gold, I am examining the history of communications and new media and textual scholarship. With this list, I aim to read letters written after several generations of telegraphy. Once epistolary communication was no longer purely reserved for nobility and was a popular medium, its audiences’ expectations shifted. I cannot pretend I will know sufficient historical context of each of the eras represented in these letters, but I am hoping each example will allow me investigate the pressures of time in an illustrative range of contexts.
