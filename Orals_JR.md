# Philosophical Correspondence
## Towards a Philosophy or Psychology of Correspondence
## Mnemonic Phenomenology: Corresponding Times

## Rationale
This portion of the bibliography establishes a notion of social self-understanding as meaning a recognition of parallel timelines (I understand myself by understanding my past-present-future as relational to yours). I want to figure out how letters act as elaborations/elongations of the understanding of two separate time-spaces and how they operate on a notion of correspondence through asynchronous synchronicity. Brian Rotmanâ€™s *Becoming Beside Ourselves* offers a vastly productive space by outlining the increasingly distributed human being. It is not that our letters merely provide paper traces or documentation of time past. These extensions and expansions embody our virtual selves across consciousnesses. As these communications multiply in the digital sphere -- through the many platforms of personal correspondence -- the extent of shared memory is exponentially expanded. Can individuals fathom the breadth of these expansions, or do our gestures accrete in ways only perceived at another scale?
